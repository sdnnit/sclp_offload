## SCLP offload module


### Overview

SCLP (Segment-oriented Connection-less Protocol) is a novel L4 protocol 
for accelerating performance of existing tunneling protocols, such as 
VXLAN and NVGRE. The SCLP protocol is designed to take advantage of 
a GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) and a GRO (Generic Receive Offload) 
features of the Linux kernel, and this module contains full-implementation 
of both features for SCLP.

### Install

### 1. Getting the source code of the SCLP offload module

You can download the code from the GitHub repository.

    https://github.com/sdnnit/sclp_offload


### 2. Bulding the SCLP offload module

To build the module, you can simply use the make system

```sh
$ make
```

If the building process succeeds, 'sclp_offload.ko' file is created in the current directory.


### 3. Installing the SCLP offload module

```sh
# insmod sclp_offload.ko
```
